# Using Disqus on AJAX/Single page applications

This is an example of how to use DISQUS.reset to change the identifier, URL, title and language of a thread without reloading the page.

This function won't circumvent the need for each unique discussion to have a unique URL and identifier. For more information see: [Why are the same comments showing up on multiple pages?](http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/662547)

## Prerequisites

* Make sure you've registered a [Disqus site](http://disqus.com/admin/create/) (also known as a shortname)
